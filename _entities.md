  The <code>memberAt</code> field can be <code>null</code> if the user hasn't completed the membership process.
  Any information needed for membership will be included in the <a href="#user-verifications">verifications</a> field.
  Note that this is distinct from the <code>pending</code> <a href="#user-status">user status</a>, which is related to the initial signup process.
</aside>

### User Settings

- **otp.login.enabled** - This will prompt the user to input an OTP token when creating an OAuth token.
- **otp.transactions.send.enabled** - This will prompt the user to input an OTP token when creating a transaction to another user.
- **otp.transactions.transfer.enabled** - This will prompt the user to input an OTP token when transacting between the user's own cards.
- **otp.transactions.withdraw.crypto.enabled** - This will prompt the user to input an OTP token when withdrawing to the bitcoin network.
- **otp.vmc.enabled** - This will prompt the user to input an OTP token when using VMCs.

### User Status

We communicate a number of different user statuses through our API.
At a high-level users can be in one of four statuses:

- **pending** - This status applies to a user that is in the process of creating an account;
  it means the signup process is not yet finalized.
- **restricted** - This status means the user is allowed to login to the application, deposit or receive money, and perform trades, but they are not permitted to withdraw nor send money to other users.
  This status exists to allow users to satisfy additional data requirements.
- **blocked** - This status is present when a user has violated our terms of service.
  In this status users are unable to login or access the product.
- **ok** - Everything is ay-ok.

### User Verifications

The `verifications` field can help communicate the reasons for a given user status, or what's missing to complete the membership process.
These verifications have permissible values and in some cases, an associated reason.
